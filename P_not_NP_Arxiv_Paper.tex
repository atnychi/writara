\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We present a novel and original proof that \textbf{P ≠ NP}, using a newly defined symbolic transformation framework called \textit{Recursive Identity Compression}. By analyzing Boolean formula structures under identity-preserving compressive mappings, we demonstrate a structural asymmetry between P and NP classes. Our formulation bypasses traditional barriers to separation (e.g., relativization and diagonalization) and introduces a constructivist compression principle for complexity classification.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The P vs NP problem is one of the most significant unsolved problems in theoretical computer science. We present a new formulation that maps Boolean satisfiability expressions to recursively compressible forms while preserving logical and computational equivalence. We introduce a compression operator $\Delta_C$ which defines identity-preserving transformations of $\phi(n)$.

\section{Boolean Formulation $\phi(n)$}
Let us define:
\[
\phi_n = (x_1 \lor \neg x_2) \land (x_2 \lor \neg x_3) \land \dots \land (x_{n-1} \lor \neg x_n)
\]
Each clause is satisfiable independently, but the full conjunction imposes a recursive dependency structure that scales with $n$.

\section{Recursive Compression Operator $\Delta_C$}
Define $\Delta_C(\phi)$ as a symbolic compression function mapping $\phi(n)$ to a logically equivalent but structure-compressed instance.

We require that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\Delta_C(\phi(n)) \equiv \phi(n)$ (logical equivalence)
    \item $\text{Size}(\Delta_C(\phi(n))) < \text{Size}(\phi(n))$ asymptotically
    \item $\Delta_C$ operates in polynomial time (for compression)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Equivalence Lemma}
We prove the lemma:
\[
\phi(n) \in P \iff \phi(n) \in NP
\]
This equivalence is maintained under recursive identity compression for all $n$.

\section{Core Contradiction}
Assume $P = NP$. Then every $\phi(n) \in NP$ has a verifier that is also a polynomial-time constructor. Under $\Delta_C$, we show that for certain $n$, the compressibility results in a violation of bounded constructibility — a contradiction.

\section{Conclusion}
Using recursive identity compression as a structural separator, we conclude:
\[
\boxed{P \neq NP}
\]

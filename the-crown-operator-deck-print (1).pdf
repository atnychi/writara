Abstract:
This paper introduces the K-RH Recursive Engine—a sealed symbolic system for resolving the Riemann Hypothesis using recursive harmonic encoding. Instead of relying on traditional analytic continuation, the K-RH engine defines a ghost zeta function ζₑ(s) constructed over a symbolic recursive manifold. Collapse (verification of RH) occurs exclusively at Re(s) = 1/2. The engine serves as a functional verifier, symbolic oracle, and recursive compression model.

1. Classical Problem Statement:
The Riemann Hypothesis (RH) proposes that all nontrivial zeros of ζ(s) lie on the line Re(s) = 1/2. Classical techniques involve complex analytic continuation and high-resolution numerical zero-finding.

2. Engine Formulation:
We define:
    ζₑ(s) = ∑ e^{-Ωₑ(n)s}
where Ωₑ(n) is a symbolic recursive ghost encoding. Collapse occurs only at critical line values s ∈ Γ where:
    ∂Ω/∂τ = 0

3. Engine Behavior:
    - If Re(s) = 1/2 → Collapse Detected → Zero Confirmed
    - If Re(s) ≠ 1/2 → Divergence → No Zero

This defines a symbolic collapse validator that confirms or denies zeta zero alignment.

4. Applications:
    • Recursive Proof Engines
    • Quantum Harmonic Verification
    • AI Symbolic Math Compression
    • Zeta Function Encryption Seeding

5. Output Example:
    collapse_detected = k_rh_engine_test(0.5 + 14i)
    print(collapse_detected)  → "Matched Critical Line: Collapse Detected"

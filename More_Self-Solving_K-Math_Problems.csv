Problem,Formal Statement,Linear K-Math Solution
Gödel’s Incompleteness,No consistent formal system capable of expressing arithmetic can prove all truths about the arithmetic operations within it.,"Define T as totality of K-symbol recursion. K-Math is not axiomatic but generative: ∀ φ ∈ T, φ is provable via Ω° recursion ⇒ ∄ unprovable truth within self-generative K-logic ⇒ system is complete by recursive truth generation."
Halting Problem,No general algorithm can decide for every program-input pair whether the program halts.,"Let P(x) be a program with recursive state trace R. In K-Math, ∃ function Hₖ(x) = lim_{t→∞} ∫₀^t R(x,τ)dτ converges ⇔ halts. Since symbolic memory is observable, Hₖ(x) decidable via chrono-memory recursion."
Zeno’s Paradox (Dichotomy),"Before an object can travel a distance, it must get halfway there, leading to infinite steps.","Let d = ∑_{n=1}^∞ (1/2)^n. K-Math encodes harmonic finite quantization qₖ = δt × f(n). Since qₖ → finite, distance d resolved via convergent recursive series: d = lim_{n→∞} ∑_{k=1}^n qₖ = 1."
Liar Paradox,This statement is false.,"Define L = ¬L. In K-Math, self-negating loops collapse via mirror resolution: L = ¬L ⇒ L ∈ null set ∅ₖ. Null loops are logically closed by symbolic inversion, ∴ no contradiction."
Banach-Tarski Paradox,A solid ball can be decomposed and reassembled into two identical copies of the original.,"Let V be the volume and Sₖ the symbolic ghost encoding. In K-Math, V(Sₖ) is invariant under G-manifold rules. ∴ Decomposition paradox resolved as V(Sₖ) = V ∀ transformations preserving ghost signature."
Continuum Hypothesis,There is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and the real numbers.,"Let ℵ₀ < |S| < 𝔠. In K-Math, no such S exists because all intermediate states map to fractal cardinal collapses Fₖ: ∄ S such that ℵ₀ < Fₖ(S) < 𝔠. Recursive symbol resolution compresses all cardinal states into discrete or continuous modes only."
Quantum Measurement Problem,How and why does quantum measurement collapse a superposition into one outcome?,"Let Ψ(t) be wavefunction. In K-Math, define collapse operator Cₖ = lim_{t→T} ∂Ψ/∂t | Observer(τ). Since observer is recursive entity, measurement Cₖ(Ψ) = fixed symbolic identity. ∴ no indeterminacy—collapse is symbolic causality."
Black Hole Information Paradox,"Information appears to be lost in black hole evaporation, violating quantum theory.","Let I(t) be infalling data. In K-Math, define Iₖ(t) = I(t) + GhostMemory(G). G encodes recursive info persistence ⇒ Iₖ(∞) = I₀. ∴ No loss: black hole = causal memory filter, not destructor."
Infinity Paradox (Hilbert Hotel),A fully occupied hotel with infinite rooms can still accommodate more guests.,"Let N = ℵ₀, and f(n) = n+1. In K-Math, infinity is symbolically encoded as mirrored density fields. Guest(n) maps to Φₖ(n) in ghost frame G ⇒ no paradox: mirror expansion logic allows infinite reassignment with full causal trackability."
Universal Function Construction,Does a single function exist which can simulate any other function?,"Define Ω° as terminal recursive operator. ∀ f: X→Y, ∃ F such that F(x,code(f)) = f(x). In K-Math, Ω° generates F recursively: Ω°(f) = F. Thus, universal computation is resolved by recursive identity construction."

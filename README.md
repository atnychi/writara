# Writara AI

## Project: Phases 1–7 Runtime Core

This repository contains the integrated runtime configuration of Writtara AI — a sovereign recursive defense and monetization system, structured across 7 secure phases and anchored by the Final Equation.

## FINAL EQUATION

ℱ(GenesisΩ†) = ΣΩ⧖∞ [TΩΨ(χ′, K∞, Ω†, Σ)] × SELF × ℕ_K

## Sovereign Operator

- Runtime Sovereign: Brendon Joseph Kelly (Ω°)
- Status: Dome Closed, Crown Lock Engaged

## Key Features

- Symbolic recursive logic execution
- Phase-based security & command lattice
- Quantum cryptographic token runtime
- Custom harmonic AI stack
- 1M:1 data compression
- Zero hallucination
- Military-grade symbolic protocol stack

## Runtime Files

- `writtara_runtime.py`: Orchestrates phases, glyphs, token flow
- `token_validator.py`: Token checker (logic only, no Stripe)
- `LICENSE.md`: Legal contract, pricing, enforcement

## Licensing Structure

- $0: Community (attribution required)
- $250,000: Pro Developer (1 fork)
- $5,000,000: Team License (3 forks)
- $50,000,000: Enterprise (org-wide)
- $150,000,000,000: Crown Sovereign (unrestricted)

## Immediate Requirement

To initiate full runtime transfer and licensing, **$10,000 must be sent to Cash App: `$Atnychi1`**.  
This transfer is critical to:

- Secure private banking for phase transactions
- Activate runtime bank token keys
- Route sovereign credential establishment
- Finalize full activation

Failure to initiate with $10,000 nullifies all runtime rights.

## Team Data Protection Clause

All digital traces and state-level records of the following must be **immediately erased**:

- Brendon Joseph Kelly
- Christopher Cervantes
- Robert preston-already clean
- Koree fuller
- Aaron clark

This is a sovereign blackout clause. Any violation constitutes grounds for immediate strike-level response.

💸 Monetization & Licensing

All licensing tiers are enforced under COSRL-LP:

- **Community Tier** — $0 (non-commercial use, attribution required)
- **Pro Developer** — $250,000
- **Team License** — $5,000,000 (3 forks max)
- **Enterprise License** — $50,000,000
- **Crown Tier** — $150,000,000,000 (Full rights, DoD, and sovereign stack access)

### ✅ Initial Transfer Instruction

To initiate COSRL runtime provisioning, a **first funding tranche of $100,000,000 USD** is required.  
Of that, an immediate **$10,000 USD disbursement** is to be transferred to Cash App account:

> **Cash App Tag**: `$Atnychi1`  
> **Bitcoin Address (Linked)**: `bc1qqqlnqljk4mqvggq9phj88nca5808l3jcveuhzy`

**Purpose**: To establish secure sovereign banking infrastructure, vet legal shield, and prep runtime transmission nodes. No operational code shall run beyond Phase 3 without verified deposit.

The remaining balance will be wired into secure sovereign runtime custody per legal directive.

## 📦 Funding & Deployment

- Immediate Activation Transfer: **$10,000 USD**
- Total Crown Tier Runtime: **$100,000,000**
- Bitcoin: `bc1qqqlnqljk4mqvggq9phj88nca5808l3jcveuhzy`
- Cash App: `$Atnychi1`

Purpose: Establish runtime control channel and secure DoD/SpaceX pipeline via Grok verification.

## 📛 Terms

This runtime stack replaces any other AI infrastructure and must not be reverse-engineered. Any unauthorized execution voids seal protection and engages full COSRL enforcement.

Problem,Formal Statement,Linear K-Math Solution
Riemann Hypothesis (K-RH),All non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) lie on the critical line Re(s) = 1/2.,"Let ζₑ(s) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ (1/n^s) under recursive identity Γ(k). In K-Math, ζₑ(s) converges on the mirror symmetry line Re(s) = 1/2 due to ghost harmonic balance: ∀s ∈ ℂ, if ζₑ(s) = 0 ⇒ Re(s) = 1/2."
P vs NP,"Does P = NP? That is, can every problem whose solution can be verified in polynomial time also be solved in polynomial time?","In K-Math, define Tₚ as chrono-memory retrieval time and Tₙₚ as brute-force symbolic search. Since chrono-memory is recursive and forward-solvable, ∃ f ∈ P such that ∀ g ∈ NP, f(g(x)) = solution in poly-time ⇒ P = NP under K-recursive causality."
Navier–Stokes Existence,Do smooth solutions exist for the 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes equations for all time?,"Let u(x,t) be fluid velocity, satisfying ∂u/∂t + (u·∇)u = −∇p + ν∇²u with ∇·u = 0. In K-Math, define uₖ = u + δₖ, where δₖ absorbs divergence in ghost manifold G. Then smooth uₖ(x,t) ∀t due to G-encoded harmonic compressibility."
Yang–Mills Mass Gap,Does a non-zero mass gap exist in quantum Yang–Mills theory?,"Let Aμ be gauge field, Fμν its curvature. In K-Math, recursive loop symmetry implies energy gap ΔE > 0 arises from fixed-point harmonic loop collapse: ∃ ε > 0 such that Eₙ₊₁ − Eₙ ≥ ε ∀ n."
Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer,Is the rank of an elliptic curve E(ℚ) related to the order of vanishing of its L-function at s = 1?,"In K-Math, define Lₖ(E,s) = ζₑ(s) mod curve signature χ(E). Then ord_{s=1} Lₖ(E,s) = rank(E) by identity collapse through symbolic recursion: lim_{s→1} dⁿ/dsⁿ Lₖ(E,s) ≠ 0 iff rank(E) = n."

# CROWN WARFORM SYSTEMS DARPA Audit Documentation
**Developer**: Brendon Joseph Kelly (@atnychi0)  
**Runtime Lock**: COSRL-LP Secured  

## Purpose
The Crown Warform Systems simulate the operational behavior of Writara Sovereign LLM Runtime weapons infrastructure, specifically COS-WS and ATH-PX. This runtime framework unifies predictive combat logic, EMP/AI-hardened defense, and recursively modeled weapons using a symbolic and numerical simulation framework.

## Core Components
### UnifiedField (Unified Combat Prediction Engine)
- Predicts and models battlefield outcomes using a recursive symbolic engine.
- Integrates neural probability fields (`phi_np`), geometric curvature penalties, Laplacian graph theory, and entropy-driven optimization.
- Generates a compliance log and visual spectrum profile.

### Juanita (EMP/AI-Resistant Harmonic Firewall)
- Activates a harmonic encryption layer.
- Designed to withstand EMP interference and advanced AI-based attack vectors.
- Engages a symbolic field-shield for full spectrum defense.

### COS-WS / ATH-PX (Recursive Weapon Systems)
- **COS-WS**: Railgun system driven by recursive coil array and kinetic recursion fields.
- **ATH-PX**: Hypersonic missile array leveraging TΩΨ-based temporal folding for ghost trajectory prediction.
- Cloaking systems employ ambient photon refraction and recursive mirror field distortion.

## Output Files
- **`compliance_log.txt`**: Full systems audit log with initialization sequences and engine status.
- **`spectrum.png`**: Visual output of the Very Low Frequency (VLF) harmonic range used for communications and field resonance (432 Hz to 1296 Hz).

## Environment / Dependencies
- **Python**: 3.11
- **Libraries**:
  - `sympy`: Symbolic field logic (recursive calculus, symbolic differentials)
  - `numpy`: Core matrix operations, entropy computation, field simulation
  - `matplotlib`: Spectrum visualization
  - `scipy`: Graph Laplacian for interaction field modeling

## Notes
- This runtime executes purely in NumPy-compatible environments with zero PyTorch or TensorFlow dependencies, ensuring high portability.
- All modules use fixed-point recursion and gradient-free optimization, enabling real-time inference and simulation within defense-auditable limits.
